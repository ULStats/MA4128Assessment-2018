Kxb Data the worlds fastest time series database.
=====================================================================================
Kx Systems, a subsidiary of First Derivatives plc (FD), announces that Citadel, a global investment firm, has expanded its use of Kx technology to help support its investment research process.

Kx is a global technology provider with 20 years of experience working with some of the world’s largest finance, technology, retail, pharma, manufacturing and energy institutions. Kx technology, incorporating the kdb+ time-series database, is a leader in high-performance, in-memory computing, streaming analytics and operational intelligence. Kx delivers the best possible performance and flexibility for high-volume, data-intensive analytics and applications across multiple industries. The Group operates from 14 offices across Europe, North America and Asia Pacific, including its headquarters in Newry, and employs more than 2,000 people worldwide.

Kx’s time-series database kdb+ is widely used in the financial services industry for trading and risk management platforms. Its unique ability to optimize both in-memory and on-disk memory resources is one reason it sets industry records for speed, performance and stability when performing complex analytics on extremely large-scale datasets. These attributes are increasingly being recognized across a range of markets requiring fast analytics on Big Data, such as manufacturing and retail which face similarly demanding data challenges.

Kx Systems was founded to address one of the most basic problems in high-performance computing: the inability of traditional relational database technology to keep up with the explosive escalation of data volumes. Ever since, the company’s singular goal has been to provide its customers with the most efficient and flexible tools for ultra-high-speed processing of real-time, streaming and historical data.

Kx is a suite of enterprise-level products centered around kdb+, the world’s fastest time series database. Kdb+ is optimized for ingesting, analyzing, and storing massive amounts of structured data. The combination of the columnar design of kdb+ and its in-memory capabilities means it offers greater speed and efficiency than typical relational databases. Its native support for time-series operations vastly improves both the speed and performance of queries, aggregation, and analysis of structured data.

What are the Key Features of Kx Technology? 
The world’s fastest time-series column-store database. Streaming, real-time and historical data in one platform. Kx runs on Linux, Windows, Solaris, and MacOS,commodity hardware, cloud, edge devices/appliances.

Why is Kx so Fast?
Performance is key to the underlying design of Kx, and the database has a number of important characteristics that contribute to its speed. Kx automatically distributes database operations across CPU cores, exploits vector instructions from Intel and ARM chipsets.
Database tables are first class objects in q programming language, a wide variety of data types for compact storage and supports software and hardware compression.

Some Kx Performance Snippets;
Streaming – Process and analyse 4.5 million bulk events per second per core.
Scan – Search in-memory tables at 4 billion records per second per core.
Batch – Ingest data at 10 million records per second per core.
Store – Accumulate 10 trillion data points (3 PB,A petabyte (PB) is 1,000 terabytes (TB) or 1,000,000 gigabytes (GB)) of NYSE data.
Usage – Trusted by 17 of the world’s top 20 investment banks.
Volume – Daily volumes of 1.6 TB of streaming data per day.
Scale – From Raspberry Pi, edge devices to 20,000 cores on AWS Cloud.
Performance – Top performing time-series database according to STAC Research.
Latency – Sub-millisecond latency for streaming event processing.

One feature that really sets Kx apart is its ability to combine streaming, in-memory and historical data in one simple and unified platform; there is no requirement to acquire disparate components to build a hybrid solution.

For many of today’s businesses, the promise of big data analytics is the ability to use both streaming and the vast amounts of historical data effectively. This includes data that will accumulate over future years, as well as data a business may already have warehoused but have never been able to use. The means by which a database uses data storage, both in-memory and on-disk, can make a tremendous difference in the speed and cost of analytics it can produce.

The diagram below illustrates the Kx suite of technology, all built on the core kdb+ engine. Included are standard programing language interfaces, SOA interoperability, complex event processors, and an adapter framework used for ingesting data from external data sources.
