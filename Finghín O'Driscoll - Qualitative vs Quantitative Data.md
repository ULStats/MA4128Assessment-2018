# Qualitative vs Quantitative Data
## Introduction
There exists a fundamental distinction between two types of data: qualitative and quantitative. The way we typically define them, we call data 'quantitative' if it is in numerical form and 'qualitative' if it is not. 
Quantitative data is information about quantities; that is, information that can be measured and written down with numbers. Some examples of quantitative data are your height, your shoe size, and the length of your fingernails. Speaking of which, it might be time to call Guinness. You've got to be close to breaking the record.Qualitative data is information about qualities; information that can't actually be measured. Some examples of qualitative data are the softness of your skin, the grace with which you run, and the color of your eyes. However, try telling Photoshop you can't measure color with numbers.

Here's a quick look at the difference between qualitative and quantitative data. 
* The age of your car. (Quantitative.)  
* The number of hairs on your knuckle. (Quantitative.)  
* The softness of a cat. (Qualitative.)  
* The color of the sky. (Qualitative.)  
* The number of pennies in your pocket. (Quantitative.)

Remember, if we're measuring a quantity, we're making a statement about quantitative data. If we're describing qualities, we're making a statement about qualitative data. Keep your L's and N's together and it shouldn't be too tough to keep straight.
## Cases for Qualitative Analytics
Qualitative researchers use a variety of methods to develop deep understandings of how people perceive their social realities and in consequence, how they act within the social world. For example, diary accounts, open-ended questionnaires, documents, participant observation, and ethnography.

## Data Analysis
Qualitative research is endlessly creative and interpretive. The researcher does not just leave the field with mountains of empirical data and then easily write up his	or her findings. Qualitative interpretations are constructed, and various techniques can be used to make sense of the data, such as	 content analysis, grounded theory (Glaser & Strauss, 1967), thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006) or discourse analysis.
## Key Features
* Events can be understood adequately only if they are seen in context. Therefore, a qualitative researcher immerses her/himself in the field, in natural surroundings. The contexts of inquiry are not contrived; they are natural. Nothing is predefined or taken for granted.        
* Qualitative researchers want those who are studied to speak for themselves, to provide their perspectives in words and other actions. Therefore, qualitative research is an interactive process in which the persons studied teach the researcher about their lives.     	    * The qualitative researcher is an integral part of the data, without the active participation of the researcher, no data exists.    	  * The design of the study evolves during the research, and can be adjusted or changed as it progresses.   
* For the qualitative researcher, there is no single reality, it is subjective and exist only in reference to the observer.   
* Theory is data driven, and emerges as part of the research process, evolving from the data as they are collected. 

## Limitations
Because of the time and costs involved, qualitative designs do not generally draw samples from large-scale data sets.The problem of adequate validity or reliability is a major criticism. Because of the subjective nature of qualitative data and its origin in single contexts, it is difficult to apply conventional standards of reliability and validity. For example, because of the central role played by the researcher in the generation of data, it is not possible to replicate qualitative studies. Also, contexts, situations, events, conditions, and interactions cannot be replicated to any extent nor can generalizations be made to a wider context than the one studied with any confidenceThe time required for data collection, analysis and interpretation are lengthy. Analysis of qualitative data is difficult and expert knowledge of an area is necessary to try to interpret qualitative data, and great care must be taken when doing so, for example, if looking for symptoms of mental illness.
## Strengths
Because of close researcher involvement, the researcher gains an insider's view of the field. This allows the researcher to find issues that are often missed (such as subtleties and complexities) by the scientific, more positivistic inquiries.                       Qualitative descriptions can play the important role of suggesting possible relationships, causes, effects and dynamic processes.Qualitative analysis allows for ambiguities/contradictions in the data, which are a reflection of social reality (Denscombe, 2010).Qualitative research uses a descriptive, narrative style; this research might be of particular benefit to the practitioner as she or he could turn to qualitative reports in order to examine forms of knowledge that might otherwise be unavailable, thereby gaining new insight.  
## When would you use qualitive analytics?
### 1) Finding out why a customer decided to do business with you
Understanding what prompted a customer to choose your business over a competitor’s will help you pinpoint what your competitive advantage is and how to sell your product or service. Qualitative analytics can come in handy in this case: ask questions like ‘Why did you sign up?’ and ‘Why did you visit this page?' in order to collect data that will help you. Make sure you word the question so it’s open-ended and can generate more authentic responses from customers.
### 2) Finding out what customer’s perception of your value proposition is
Sometimes you think you know what value your product or service gives to customers. But once you ask customers what value they think you provide, you might be surprised to hear their responses. This can change the way you package your service or how you sell your product.
### 3) Fishing for copy language
The language your customers use is really golden. When you’re looking for best ways to write your pay-per-click (PPC) ad copy, you’ll want to first understand how customers write about your product or service. You can use your customer’s own words in your ad copy! 

## Cases for Quantitative Analytics
Quantitative research gathers data in a numerical form which can be put into categories, or in rank order, or measured in units of measurement.  This type of data can be used to construct graphs and tables of raw data.

## Data Analysis
Statistics help us turn quantitative data into useful information to help with decision making. We can use statistics to summarise our data, describing patterns, relationships,	and connections. Statistics can be descriptive or inferential. Descriptive statistics help us to summarise our data whereas inferential statistics are used to identify statistically significant differences between groups of data (such as intervention and control groups in a		randomised control study).
## Key Features
* Quantitative researchers try to control extraneous variables by conducting their studies in the lab.
* The research aims for objectivity (i.e., without bias), and is separated from the data.  
* The design of the study is determined before it begins. 
* For the quantitative researcher reality is objective and exist separately to the researcher, and is capable of being seen by anyone.    * Research is used to test a theory and ultimately support or reject it. 

## Limitations
Context: Quantitative experiments do not take place in natural settings. In addition, they do not allow participants to explain their choices or the meaning of the questions may have for those participants (Carr, 1994).Researcher expertise: Poor knowledge of the application of statistical analysis may negatively affect analysis and subsequent interpretation (Black, 1999).Variability of data quantity: Large sample sizes are needed for more accurate analysis. Small scale quantitative studies may be less reliable because of the low quantity of data (Denscombe, 2010). This also affects the ability to generalize study findings to wider populations.Confirmation bias: The researcher might miss observing phenomena because of focus on theory or hypothesis testing rather than on the theory of hypothesis generation. 
## Strengths
Scientific objectivity: Quantitative data can be interpreted with statistical analysis, and since statistics are based on the principles of mathematics, the quantitative approach is viewed as scientifically objective, and rational (Carr, 1994; Denscombe, 2010). 
Useful for testing and validating already constructed theories.
Rapid analysis: Sophisticated software removes much of the need for prolonged data analysis, especially with large volumes of data involved (Antonius, 2003).
   Replication: Quantitative data is based on measured values and can be checked by others because numerical data is less open to ambiguities of interpretation. Hypotheses can also be tested because of the used of statistical analysis (Antonius, 2003). 

## When would you use quantative analytics?
### 1) Understanding how customers are using the product
You can use quantitative analytics to understand how customers use your product or service. This will give you data points that back up what value you think you give to customers based on what features they use most often.  You can find out not just who the habitual users are, but how often they use certain features and which features they use. 
### 2) Basic traffic reporting
You can find out where most of your website traffic is coming from by using quantitative analytics. Through Google Analytics, you can figure out where the organic search requests come from and which specific media channels are bringing in the most people.
### 3) Conversion funnel
Use quantitative analytics when you’re trying to identify where customers abandon your conversion funnel. You can use this data to create a strategy to improve certain steps of the funnel so you can increase the overall conversion rate. l
