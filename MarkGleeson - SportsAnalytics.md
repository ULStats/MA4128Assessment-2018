# **What is sports analytics?**

There are two key aspects of sports analytics - on-field and off-field analytics. On-field analytics deals with improving the on-field performance of teams and players. It digs deep into aspects such as game tactics and player fitness. Off-field analytics deals with the business side of sports. For this purpose of this exercise, we will deal solely with on-field analytics.

Sports all over the world have developed hugely over the past years. Training methods are more specific, so-called weaknesses in opposition players are highlighted and coaches have furthered their knowledge of how to get the most from their players. This development is primarily as a result of the use of data analytics in sport. 

## **History**

The rise of this began when the Oakland A’s baseball team used data and statistics to completely turn around their ball club in the early 2000s. It also brought the concept of sports analytics into the limelight. The squad was built completely from statistics and personal views or beliefs were dismissed. Perceived ‘weaker’ players were drafted into the team based on their stats from previous seasons. This change is depicted in the world-famous film – Moneyball. The image below depicts one of the statistic sheets based on one player for the Oakland A's.



##**Use**

Almost every team/individual or organisation (depending on the sport) has one or many persons working solely on the gathering stats and integrating these into useful material. Originally, this was associated with professional backgrounds but today, it is fully in operation with amateur teams also.  Performance statistics, such as number of kicks, number of tackles etc, are collected on every training session and match. These data are inherently multivariate, as an individual’s performance stats may be related to each other and are often structured in terms of time and space.

The aim of having such data is, presumably, to aid decision making at a management level or perhaps to highlight areas for improvement at a player level. Even though such performance data are typically not-so-big, it is no less important to model the data appropriately. Thus, visualising and modelling such data in an appropriate statistical manner is the key to making good data-driven decisions.
