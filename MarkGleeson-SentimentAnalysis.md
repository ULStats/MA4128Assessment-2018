**Definition**

Sentiment analysis, also known as ‘opinion mining’, refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information.

>In essence, it is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a series of words, used to gain an understanding of the attitudes, opinions and emotions expressed within an online mention.

**Sentiment Analysis Uses**

Sentiment analysis is widely applied within the use of a VOC (Voice of the Customer), which is often completed in the form of an interview, survey or questionnaire. A VOC is a vital part of a new product development, and gives an organisation an insight into the feelings and opinions of potential customers to the prospect of this new product.

Sentiment analysis is extremely useful in social media monitoring as it allows us to gain an overview of the wider public opinion behind certain topics. Social media monitoring tools make that process quicker and easier than ever before, thanks to real-time monitoring capabilities. Brandwatch Analytics is an example of an online monitoring tool.

Twitter is another example of a company which utilizes a sentimental analysis approach, allowing its users to gain the feelings and opinions of others towards particular topics – for example, the opinion of shopping quality experience in a particular area/street. Key words are imputed and from this, the Twitter sentiment analysis is able to search a database for recent tweets which contain the key word and a reaction towards it. From tweets containing a reaction about a certain product, advertisement, etc. the company is then able to use this feedback to their advantage.

**Important to note:**

However, one important aspect with regards to sentiment analysis is its ability, or lack of, to understand contextual language and tone. Something which may look obvious to a human often gets mis understood by a machine. A simple example of this would be if someone were to say “Caught late in work again…. Brilliant”. To a human, this is obviously sarcastic, however, to a machine, the word ‘brilliant’ indicates that this is a positive. The machine cannot distinguish this realisation and so, the data can be wrong.
