Focused on financial institutions that work cross-asset, often with multi-system and/or high volume trading activities, the Company scopes, designs, develops, implements and supports a broad range of mission critical data and trading systems across front, middle and back-office operations. The Company’s software is also used in a range of industries including telecoms, digital marketing, pharma and utilities to help organisations solve their most demanding data management and analytics challenges.

## Foundation
Incorporated in 1996, FD has served the capital markets industry since its incorporation. The Company holds a niche market position in terms of domain knowledge of capital market asset classes (equities, fixed income, foreign exchange, commodities, etc), as well as expertise in leading financial services systems (such as Calypso, Murex, Opics, Summit, Principia, Opus, Wall Street, kdb+, etc). 

The Company continues to work closely with leading global financial institutions to enable client proprietary and 3rd Party systems cope with the demands of high volume, complex trading in an increasingly regulated market. This combination of domain knowledge and technical expertise in leading financial services technologies has motivated the Company to invest in developing its own product suite.

# Public

FD’s distinct competitive advantage derives from its unique combination of knowledge of financial markets and expertise in financial services technologies.
